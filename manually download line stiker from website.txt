When you get sticker using the second URL format, then in the ZIP package, it will contain a list of static and additional folder type image files (animation, popup or sound).
This additional folder (animation/popup) can be converted to GIF of animated LINE sticker. As information, the files in animation folder are with APNG ( Animation PNG) extensions. Therefore, to change or convert APNG to GIF, you can use free software, or it can be done through online converter web such as Animizer 'icons8. com/animizer'.
